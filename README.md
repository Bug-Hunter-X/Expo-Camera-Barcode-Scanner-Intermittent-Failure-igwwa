# Expo Camera Barcode Scanner Intermittency

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where the barcode scanner intermittently fails to recognize barcodes. The issue is not related to the camera preview or any apparent errors; it appears to be a problem with the barcode recognition logic within Expo's implementation. The bug is not consistently reproducible, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an iOS or Android device/simulator.
4. Point the camera at a barcode. The scanner may or may not detect the barcode consistently.

## Solution

The proposed solution attempts to improve reliability by adding a small delay to the barcode scan handling.  While not a guaranteed fix, it is an approach that may reduce the frequency of failures for some users.

## Further Investigation

Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause of this intermittency.  Potential areas of exploration include:
* Investigating Expo's barcode scanning library.
* Testing with different barcode types and formats.
* Analyzing the timing and conditions under which failures occur.
* Examining the device hardware and software configuration.
